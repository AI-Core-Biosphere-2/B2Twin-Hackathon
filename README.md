# B2Twin-Hackathon

B2Twin Hackathon March 22 & 23, 2025

## Introduction

Biosphere 2, a research facility unlike any other in the world, stands as a testament to our quest for understanding Earth's intricate and intelligent ecosystems. Inspired by Buckminster Fuller's "Spaceship Earth," it is the worldâ€™s largest controlled environment dedicated to unraveling the complexities of our planet. Now, by harnessing the awesome potential of Artificial Intelligence and the ingenuity of young engineers from this university, we are poised to elevate our comprehension of these living systems to unprecedented, super-intelligent levels. This exciting collaboration marks a pathway into the future, where together we will deepen our knowledge of Earth's stewardship and explore the possibilities of off-planet living.

B2Twin is the brand name for a new AI / XR system development strategy from Biosphere 2 and AI Core. Your goal as a hacker is to develop an innovative analytical model that interprets and analyzes Biosphere 2 sensor data to help scientists restore degraded environments on Earth and prepare for space travel.  
**Please note:** Instead of creating a complete digital twin of Biosphere 2, focus on designing a model that extracts actionable insights from the data.

### Stage 1: Get Your Local LLM Up and Running
### Stage 2: Grab Starter Data from GitHub and Learn to Make It Usable for Your LLM
### Stage 3: Connect to the Comprehensive Data Archive for Full Data Access and Apply Your Model to Derive Insights
### Stage 4: Enable Communication Between Your LLMs to Collaboratively Drive Scientific Discovery

- Begin by installing an appropriately sized AI model (on average 7b parameters or less) on your device using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
- Assist other teams with step 1 and win prize tokens before moving on.
- Utilize LLMs offered through AI Core for programming assistance from Claude Sonnet 3.7 and other AI models by visiting [AI Core Chat](https://chat.aicore.arizona.edu/) and signing up (approval by the AI Core Team required).

- Download the Biosphere 2 sensor data .csv files from GitHub [Biosphere 2 Research Systems Data](https://biosphere2.org/research/systems-data)  .

- Create your own code folder and store your files in the GitHub repository that will be provided on the day of the Hackathon.
- Ensure you have current Python libraries installed: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install Visual Studio Code or a similar tool: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Install Streamlit or a similar UI library: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
- Create a .csv uploader for your AI model using these tools.
- Upload a test .csv file from Biosphere 2.
- Use your local AI model to interpret the .csv data.
- Develop a communication protocol that enables your AI to interact port-to-port with other Hack AZ AIs and the powerful Biosphere 2 reasoning model running in the cloud.
